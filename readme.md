# Simple brute force script

## Scenario

Simple login page with an obvious username and password format, i.e. 1-2 charcters for username and 1-6 digits for password, and informative login message, i.e. display "User doesn't exist" when the username is not found. 

## Logic flow

The `user.py` create 2 Python files which each of them responsible for brute forcing at a fixed length. Similar for `pass.py` which create 6 Python files because the password can be 6 digits long.
